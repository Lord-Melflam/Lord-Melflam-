# Lord Melflam 👑

MSc Computer Science Engineering — Systems • Cybersecurity • Software 
UCLouvain (EPL)

I build soltions that are **measured, optimized, and understood**.  
If it’s slow, fragile, or hand-wavy, I don’t trust it.

## Domain of Focus

- **Cybersecurity & Network**
- **Systems & Low-Level Programming**
- **Database Design & Query Optimization**
- **Performance Analysis & Benchmarking**
- **Software**

I care about how things work *under the hood*: memory, caches, indexes, execution paths.
But most importantly about how to keep tthem working in a reliable and secure way.
